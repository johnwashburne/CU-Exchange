# CU Exchange
This website is a online exchange for Clemson Student Tickets. It seeks to be a central location where student buyers and sellers can be connected, as opposed to the multitude of other platforms that are currently used for the buying and selling of tickets, such as Facebook, Reddit, and Wildfire. By hopefully bringing all of the buyers and sellers onto a single platform, we hope to make the search for a buyer or seller of a student ticket much more efficient. The frontend templates for this website were developed by Madison Wilson, Emelia Frederick, and Catherine Stewart. The backend was developed by me, and the framework used for this web app is Django, in Python. The code in this repository will not work out of the box, however, as many files have been removed to protect user security.

We wanted to limit the access of this website to Clemson students, so on the registration page, the user is required to input their student username. Because the username is a part of the student email address, when mailing the confirmation email, the user cannot verify their account unless an actual student ID was entered.

Here is the registration page:
