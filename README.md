# CU Exchange
This website is a online exchange for Clemson Student Tickets. It seeks to be a central location where student buyers and sellers can be connected, as opposed to the multitude of other platforms that are currently used for the buying and selling of tickets, such as Facebook, Reddit, and Wildfire. By hopefully bringing all of the buyers and sellers onto a single platform, we hope to make the search for a buyer or seller of a student ticket much more efficient. The backend framework used for this web app is Django, in Python. The code in this repository will not work out of the box, however, as many files have been removed to protect user security.
